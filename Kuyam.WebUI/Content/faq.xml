    <faq>
      <question>what are kuyam's cancellation policies?</question>
      <answer>
        even though as of now there are no kuyam cancellation fees associated with no-shows, we request that you respect each company by either modifying or canceling your scheduled appointment at least 2 days prior to the scheduled appointment. we strongly recommend that you modify or cancel your scheduled appointment on kuyam to make sure it goes through.

        however, if you're cancelling your appointment within two days of your scheduled time, we request that you contact the company directly. depending on each company's individual terms of use, a same day cancellation may be deemed a ‘no-show' by kuyam.

      <question>what are the no-show policies of the platform?</question>
      <answer>if the company you scheduled with reports that you did not show up to your appointment, a notice of no-show will be sent to you. after accumulating three no-show notices within twelve consecutive months your membership may be deactivated and all of your privileges to the platform may be revoked immediately. </answer>
    </faq>
    <faq>
      <question>what about cancellation fees for no-show appointments?</question>
      <answer>
        if you are concerned that the company may charge you a fee in accordance to its cancellation policy, we strongly recommend that you contact each company directly to discuss the matter.

        kuyam cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of the cancellation policy information provided by each company for publication on kuyam's online appointment schedule form, confirmation emails, or reminder emails. we strongly recommend that you contact each company directly for specifics regarding cancellation fees.
