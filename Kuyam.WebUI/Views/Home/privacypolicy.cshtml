            This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Kuyam website located
            at <a href='@Kuyam.Domain.UtilityHelper.UrlFormat("www.kuyam.com")' title='go to kuyam web'>
                www.kuyam.com </a>and all affiliated web sites owned and operated solely by
            Kuyam (collectively, the "Website"). Kuyam Companies, Inc., a California corporation,
            the provider of the Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting
            your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect
            from you (the “User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions
            about our privacy policy, please email us at <a href='mailto:support@kuyam.com' title='send mail to suport'>
                support@kuyam.com</a>.

        <p>
            PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU
            ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS

        <h3>
            1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify our privacy policy at any time, so please review
            it frequently. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will post the
            changes on this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <h3>
            2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
            We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable
            User Information and Non-Personally User Identifiable Information.</p>
        <p>
            Personally Identifiable User Information</p>
        <p>
            Personally Identifiable User Information is information that identifies a specific
            User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an
            account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content
            and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored
            by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our
            partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate
            agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers
            from third parties through the Website (collectively, “Personal Identification Activities”),
            we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for
            you to engage in a Personal Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in a
            Personal Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain
            personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address
            (including zip code), email address, telephone number, date of birth and gender.
            When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your
            credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
            Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified
            as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory
            information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted
            to engage in that activity.</p>
        <p>
            We use Personally Identifiable User Information to provide products and services
            to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website,
            improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our
            product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties
            as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer
            service an email we may use your name and comments and feedback to tell others about
            our services, and may post your name and comment in our marketing materials or on
            our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product
            to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally
            Identifiable User Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative
            tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms
            of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law
            enforcement activities.</p>
        <p>
            Non-Personally User Identifiable Information
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-Personally Identifiable User Information is information that does not identify
            a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource
            Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL
            of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are
            using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third
            Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information
            when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and
            Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Non-Personally Identifiable User Information to troubleshoot, administer
            the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable
            law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information
            with our authorized Kuyam Service Providers, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers
            to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
        <h3>
            3. Release of Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
        <p>
            We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable User Information
            with other parties except as provided below:</p>
        <p>
            We will share Personally Identifiable User Information with companies on your behalf
            to schedule appointments that you have requested.</p>
        <p>
            From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “Kuyam
            Service Providers”) who, as part of the offer, request information on Kuyam customers
            who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some
            of your Personally Identifiable User Information with Kuyam Service Providers. Sharing
            this Information may allow a Kuyam Service Provider to market directly to you should
            they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable User Information
            with a Kuyam Service Provider if you engage in a Personal Identification Activity,
            and then only to the Kuyam Service Provider involved in that Personal Identification
            Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions
            of such Kuyam Service Provider. While we inform Kuyam Service Providers that they
            are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion
            with Kuyam, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Kuyam Service
            Providers and the actions of the Kuyam Service Providers are not in our control.</p>
        <p>
            We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information with Authorized Third
            Party Service Providers. We provide services and products through third parties.
            These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending
            out and distributing our Personally Identifiable User Information administrative
            and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information
            with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or
            email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer
            lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links,
            process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer
            service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies
            (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your Personally
            Identifiable User Information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
            tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information
            to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,
            release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we
            may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage
            Kuyam Service Providers and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy
            policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable User Information by such
            parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to
            our control.</p>
        <p>
            We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users,
            based upon your past interactions with the Kuyam website. Third-party marketing
            vendors may be hired by Kuyam to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party
            vendors, including Google, may show Kuyam ads on sites on the internet. Third-party
            vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits
            to Kuyam's website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising
            opt-out page at <a href='@Kuyam.Domain.UtilityHelper.UrlFormat("www.google.com/privacy_ads.html")'>
                http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>. This information is used only for
            remarketing purposes and will not be used by them for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>
            We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information in a Business Transfer.
            As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company.
            If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain,
            including Personally Identifiable User Information. However, Personally Identifiable
            User Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            We may share your information for our protection and the protection of others. We
            reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable User Information as required
            by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or
            comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website;
            enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements;
            or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>
        <h3>
            4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
        <p>
            We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable User Information with Partners,
            Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
            (which does not include any Personally Identifiable User Information) with “Third
            Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties as provided
            below:</p>
        <p>
            We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
            These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable User Information about your
            visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network
            tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some
            of these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are
            members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). If you would like more information
            about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising
            from any NAI member company, click here: <a href='@Kuyam.Domain.UtilityHelper.UrlFormat("www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp")'>
                http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable
            User Information usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
            our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
            for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
            note that this is not Personally Identifiable User Information, only general summaries
            of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned
            and used by us.</p>
        <h3>
            5. Updating and Correcting Information</h3>
        <p>
            We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
            User Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable
            User Information by logging into your account and accessing the "settings" section
            of the site, sending us an email at <a href='mailto:support@kuyam.com' title='sent mail to support'>
                support@kuyam.com </a>or writing to us at 1901 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1900,
            Los Angeles, CA 90067. Please indicate your name, address and email address, and
            what information you would like to update when you contact us.</p>
        <p>
            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable User Information
            if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
            however, because we may keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
            associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, it may be impossible
            for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
            information.</p>
        <p>
            If you choose to store credit card information on the site, this is stored on a
            secure page and you may delete your credit card information at any time by going
            to the "settings" section of your profile.</p>
        <h3>
            6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h3>
        <p>
            As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
            may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
        <p>
            As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative
            and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity
            and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You
            cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s
            activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account,
            requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative
            Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
            Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other
            offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you
            do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving
            Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at <a href='mailto:support@kuyam.com'
                title='sent mail to support'>support@kuyam.com, </a>by writing to us at the
            address contained herein, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of
            any of our Promotional Emails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address,
            email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.</p>
        <h3>
            7. Security of Information</h3>
        <p>
            We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security
            of Personally Identifiable User Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable
            User Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This
            password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.
            In addition, your Personally Identifiable User Information resides on a secure server
            that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain
            sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer
            (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable User Information is
            safe as it is transmitted to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
            security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the
            same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from
            the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may
            receive any such information.</p>
        <h3>
            8. Data Tracking</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies. To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store
            cookies on your computer. Cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s
            computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User.
            We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are,
            and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience.
            Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable User Information from
            you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information
            helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition,
            we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website.
            As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have
            no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser.
            Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser
            settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies,
            some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>
        <p>
            Other Tracking Devices</p>
        <p>
            We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons
            to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third
            Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons
            are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails
            that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you
            access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate
            a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure
            and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as
            well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize
            pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners
            for the same purposes.</p>
        <h3>
            9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect
            from you on the Website. Other websites that may be accessible through the Website
            have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.
            If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy.
            We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
        <h3>
            10. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</h3>
        <p>
            Children. Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Website. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the
            Website is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18. Kuyam does not sell products
            for purchase by children. In certain instances, we sell children's products for
            purchase by adults. If a parent provides Personally Identifiable User Information
            about their child, we will not knowingly provide such information to our Affiliates
            and/or Marketing Partners.</p>
        <p>
            Public Areas</p>
        <p>
            We may provide areas on our Website where you can publicly post information about
            yourself, can communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, or can
            review products, services and submit media content. This information may be accessible
            by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches,
            and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For
            example, if you post your email address along with a public service provider review,
            you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings
            or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please
            use caution when posting any personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents</p>
        <p>
            California law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights
            under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (the “Act”) and the California
            Business and Professions Code. As required by the Act, we will provide you with
            the categories of Personally Identifiable User Information that we collect through
            the Website and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such
            Personally Identifiable User Information may be shared for direct marketing purposes
            at your request. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1)
            the categories of Personally Identifiable User Information we collect and what third
            parties we share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those third
