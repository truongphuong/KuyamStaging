    <h3>
        1. What we do</h3>
    <p>
        Kuyam provides services to Users for the purpose of assisting Users in securing
        appointments at participating companies and independent contractors (individually,
        a “Company” and collectively, “Companies”). In addition, the Website provides an
        online calendaring service that allows Users to keep track of the events in their
        life. In response to a User's online request for an appointment, the Website or
        Kuyam’s employee directly contacts a third party Company representative or a Company’s
        computerized database of appointments. The availability of appointments is determined
        at the time of the User's query. Once an appointment is confirmed by a Company,
        Kuyam will provide confirmation of the appointment to the User by email and/or other
        means of mutually acceptable communications between Kuyam’s platform and its Users.
        At this time, Kuyam’s Services will be free of charge to Users; however, Kuyam may
        impose a service charge in the future. By using the Services, the User agrees to
        receive appointment confirmations by email and/or other means of mutually acceptable
        communications after booking an appointment through the Website.</p>
    <h3>
        2. No Show Policy</h3>
    <p>
        To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service with the participating
        Companies, Users are asked to review each third party Company’s cancellation policies
        prior to scheduling an appointment with them through Kuyam. You may cancel your
        appointment online via Kuyam or call the business directly. In cases where the business
        has requested a credit card, there may be a cancellation charge, depending on each
        particular business’ individual policy. A same day cancellation, unless otherwise
        provided for in the Company’s cancellation policy, is a violation of Kuyam’s terms
        of use and will be deemed a no-show.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unable to keep your appointment and you fail to timely cancel the appointment,
        Kuyam will send you an email and/or other means of mutually acceptable communications
        letting you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. By using the
        Services, the User agrees to receive no-show confirmations by email and/or other
        means of mutually acceptable communications after a business and/or the Website
        reports your appointment was not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case.
        Your Kuyam account may be terminated if you are a no-show for three appointments
        within the same twelve-month period. The User agrees that a final no-show determination
        will be made by Kuyam in its sole discretion.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Kuyam is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please review our privacy
        policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
        4. Usage Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        The Services are being offered to Users for the User's personal use or the use of
        the User's immediate family or on behalf of authorized persons. The User agrees
        to use the Services only to book appointments at a participating business and to
        honor those appointments by arriving at the business on time and paying for the
        services rendered. The User further agrees not to book more than one (1) appointment
        for a single User's personal use during any one time slot. Resale or attempted resale
        of appointments is prohibited, and is grounds for, among other things, cancellation
        of the appointment, in addition to all rights and remedies under applicable state
        and federal law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any and all other uses which are unlawful or in violation of this Agreement's terms
        and conditions are prohibited. Kuyam reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
        to refuse service, suspend or terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel
        appointments.
    </p>
    <h3>
        5. Email Policy</h3>
    <p>
        You may receive periodic emails from Kuyam if you opted to receive such emails at
        the time of registration with the Website. If you would rather not receive email
        from Kuyam, please send an email to <a href='mailto:unsubscribe@kuyam.com' title='send an email to unsubscribe@kuyam.com'>
            unsubscribe@kuyam.com</a> and you will be unsubscribed
        from receiving further mailings after your email has been processed. The User acknowledges
        and agrees, however, that the User will still receive appointment confirmation emails,
        no-show confirmation emails, appointment change confirmation emails, appointment
        cancellation confirmation emails and other emails relating to appointments booked
        by the User through the Website, even if the User has opted not to receive periodic
        email from Kuyam. Please see our Privacy Policy for information as to when Kuyam
        shares your personal information.

    <h3>
        2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>
    <p>
        We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable
        User Information and Non-Personally User Identifiable Information.</p>
    <p>
        Personally Identifiable User Information</p>
    <p>
        Personally Identifiable User Information is information that identifies a specific
        User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an
        account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content
        and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored
        by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our
        partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate
        agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers
        from third parties through the Website (collectively, “Personal Identification Activities”),
        we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for
        you to engage in a Personal Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in a
        Personal Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain
        personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address
        (including zip code), email address, telephone number, date of birth and gender.
        When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your
        credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
        Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified
        as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory
        information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted
        to engage in that activity.</p>
    <p>
        We use Personally Identifiable User Information to provide products and services
        to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website,
        improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our
        product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties
        as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer
        service an email we may use your name and comments and feedback to tell others about
        our services, and may post your name and comment in our marketing materials or on
        our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product
        to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally
        Identifiable User Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative
        tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms
        of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law
        enforcement activities.</p>
    <p>
        Non-Personally User Identifiable Information
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-Personally Identifiable User Information is information that does not identify
        a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource
        Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL
        of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are
        using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third
        Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information
        when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and
        Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use Non-Personally Identifiable User Information to troubleshoot, administer
        the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable
        law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information
        with our authorized Kuyam Service Providers, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers
        to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
    <h3>
        3. Release of Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
    <p>
        We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable User Information
        with other parties except as provided below:</p>
    <p>
        We will share Personally Identifiable User Information with companies on your behalf
        to schedule appointments that you have requested.</p>
    <p>
        From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “Kuyam
        Service Providers”) who, as part of the offer, request information on Kuyam customers
        who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some
        of your Personally Identifiable User Information with Kuyam Service Providers. Sharing
        this Information may allow a Kuyam Service Provider to market directly to you should
        they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable User Information
        with a Kuyam Service Provider if you engage in a Personal Identification Activity,
        and then only to the Kuyam Service Provider involved in that Personal Identification
        Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions
        of such Kuyam Service Provider. While we inform Kuyam Service Providers that they
        are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion
        with Kuyam, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Kuyam Service
        Providers and the actions of the Kuyam Service Providers are not in our control.</p>
    <p>
        We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information with Authorized Third
        Party Service Providers. We provide services and products through third parties.
        These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending
        out and distributing our Personally Identifiable User Information administrative
        and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information
        with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or
        email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer
        lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links,
        process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer
        service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies
        (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your Personally
        Identifiable User Information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
        tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information
        to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,
        release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we
        may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage
        Kuyam Service Providers and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy
        policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable User Information by such
        parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to
        our control.</p>
    <p>
        We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users,
        based upon your past interactions with the Kuyam website. Third-party marketing
        vendors may be hired by Kuyam to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party
        vendors, including Google, may show Kuyam ads on sites on the internet. Third-party
        vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits
        to Kuyam's website.

    <p>
        We may share your Personally Identifiable User Information in a Business Transfer.
        As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company.
        If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain,
        including Personally Identifiable User Information. However, Personally Identifiable
        User Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
        We may share your information for our protection and the protection of others. We
        reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable User Information as required
        by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or
        comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website;
        enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements;
        or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>

        4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable User Information with Partners,
        Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
        (which does not include any Personally Identifiable User Information) with “Third
        Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties as provided
        below:</p>
    <p>
        We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
        These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable User Information about your
        visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network
        tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some
        of these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are
        members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). If you would like more information
        about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising
        from any NAI member company, click here: <a href='@Kuyam.Domain.UtilityHelper.UrlFormat("www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp")'>
            http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable
        User Information usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
        our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
        for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
        note that this is not Personally Identifiable User Information, only general summaries
        of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned
        and used by us.</p>
    <h3>
        5. Updating and Correcting Information</h3>
    <p>
        We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
        User Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable
        User Information by logging into your account and accessing the "settings" section
        of the site, sending us an email at <a href='mailto:support@kuyam.com' title='sent mail to support'>
            support@kuyam.com </a>or writing to us at 1901 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1900,
        Los Angeles, CA 90067. Please indicate your name, address and email address, and
        what information you would like to update when you contact us.</p>
    <p>
        We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable User Information
        if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
        however, because we may keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
        associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, it may be impossible
        for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
        information.</p>
    <p>
        If you choose to store credit card information on the site, this is stored on a
        secure page and you may delete your credit card information at any time by going
        to the "settings" section of your profile.</p>
    <h3>
        6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h3>
    <p>
        As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
        may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
    <p>
        As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative
        and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity
        and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You
        cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s
        activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account,
        requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative
        Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
        Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other
        offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you
        do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving
        Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at <a href='mailto:support@kuyam.com'
            title='sent mail to support'>support@kuyam.com, </a>by writing to us at the
        address contained herein, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of
        any of our Promotional Emails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address,
        email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.</p>
    <h3>
        7. Security of Information</h3>
    <p>
        We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security
        of Personally Identifiable User Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable
        User Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This
        password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.
        In addition, your Personally Identifiable User Information resides on a secure server
        that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain
        sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer
        (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable User Information is
        safe as it is transmitted to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
        be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
        security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the
        same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from
        the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may
        receive any such information.</p>

        8. Data Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        Cookies. To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store
        cookies on your computer. Cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s
        computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User.
        We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are,
        and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience.
        Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable User Information from
        you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information
        helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition,
        we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website.
        As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have
        no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
        cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser.
        Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser
        settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies,
        some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>
    <p>
        Other Tracking Devices</p>
    <p>
        We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons
        to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third
        Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons
        are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails
        that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you
        access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate
        a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure
        and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as
        well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize
        pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners
        for the same purposes.</p>
    <h3>
        9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h3>

        example, if you post your email address along with a public service provider review,

        Last Updated: September 9, 2012</p>
    <p>
        As a User with a verified Company profile, you may create Listings. To this end,
        you will be asked a variety of questions about the Company to be listed, including,
        but not limited to, the type of business, duration of services, number of available
        slots per appointment and/or the name or number of employees, along with the availability
        of the Company and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be
        featured in Listings via the Website, Kuyam may require verification of the Company’s
        valid physical addresses and/or phone number. Users will be able to book with a
        Listed Company via the Website, based upon the information provided in the Listing.
        You understand and agree that once a User requests an appointment with your Company
        (an “Appointment Booking”), the price for the Services requested in the Appointment
        Booking may not be altered.
    </p>
    <p>
        You understand and agree that Kuyam does not act as an insurer or as a contracting
        agent for you as a Company. If a User requests an Appointment Booking with your
        Company and receives services at or from your Company, any agreement you enter into
        with such User is between the Company and the User and Kuyam is not a party thereto.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kuyam serves as the limited authorized agent of the
        Company for the purpose of accepting payments from Users on behalf of the Company
        and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Appointment Bookings For Services</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        If an Appointment Booking is requested during the Company’s listed business hours
        and the requested Appointment Booking is for a time within 24 hours of the time
        of the request, the Company is required to confirm or reject the booking within
        60 minutes of the time the Appointment Booking is made or the Appointment Booking
        request will be automatically cancelled. If an Appointment Booking is requested
        during the Company’s listed business hours, and the requested Appointment Booking
        is for a time more than 24 hours after the time of the request, the Company is required
        to either confirm or reject the booking within 90 minutes of the time the Appointment
        Booking is requested or the Appointment Booking request will be automatically cancelled.
        If an Appointment Booking is requested after the Company’s listed business hours,
        the Company is required to either confirm or reject the Appointment Booking within
        60 minutes of the Company’s opening for business on the day following the day the
        Appointment Booking is requested or the Appointment Booking request will be automatically
        cancelled. When an Appointment Booking is requested via the Website, Kuyam will
        share with the Company the provided name of the User who has requested the appointment
        booking. If the Company does confirm an Appointment Booking within the applicable
        time period, any amounts collected by Kuyam for the requested Appointment Booking
        will be refunded to the applicable User’s credit card and any pre-authorization
        of such credit card will be released.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Services Fees</h3></p>
    <p>
        The fees displayed in each Listing (“Services Fees”) are the amounts due to the
        Company for its services, which will include Kuyam’s Appointment Fee as well as
        any third party processing fees. Where applicable, taxes will be charged in addition
        to the Services Fees. The Services Fees and applicable taxes are collectively referred
        to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”.</p>
    <p>
        <h3>Services of Kuyam as Payment Agent for Company</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Company hereby appoints Kuyam as the Company’s limited agent solely for the
        purpose of collecting the Total Fees payable by Users to the Company. Each Company
        agrees that payment made by a User to Kuyam shall be considered the same as a payment
        made directly to the Company and the Company will make the Services available to
        the User in the same manner as if the Company had directly received the Services
        Fees. Each Company agrees that Kuyam will, in accordance with the cancellation policy
        selected by the Company and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the User
        to cancel an Appointment Booking accepted by the Company, and (ii) refund to the
        User that portion of the Services Fees specified in the applicable cancellation
        policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Company,
        Kuyam assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Company.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Listing Fees</h3></p>
    <p>
        Kuyam does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you
        acknowledge and agree that Kuyam reserves the right, at any time in its sole discretion,
        to charge for and collect fees for the creation of Listings. Kuyam will provide
        notice of any Listing fee via the Website prior to implementing or changing a Listing.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Booking and Financial Terms for Users</h3></p>
    <p>
        The Company, not Kuyam, is solely responsible for honoring each confirmed Appointment
        Booking and making available any appointment reserved through the Website, email,
        text message and/or a phone call. If you, as a User, choose to make an appointment
        for the Company’s services, you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and
        restrictions associated with such appointment imposed by the Company. You acknowledge
        and agree that Kuyam is not responsible for the performance of services by the Company,
        and that Kuyam’s sole obligation is to act as the Company’s payment agent for the
        limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Company. Upon your
        payment of amounts to Kuyam which are due to the Company, your payment obligation
        to the Company for such amounts is extinguished, and Kuyam is responsible for remitting
        such amounts, less Kuyam’s Appointment Fees and/or any third party processing fees,
        to the Company. In the event that Kuyam does not remit any such amounts to a Company,
        such Company will have recourse only against Kuyam.</p>
    <p>
        Listings for Appointments will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Company
        is required to confirm an Appointment Booking within a specified time period or
        the requested Appointment Booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested
        Appointment Booking is cancelled, any amounts collected by Kuyam will be refunded
        to such User and any pre-authorization of such User’s credit card will be released,
        if applicable.</p>
    <p>
        You agree to pay Kuyam the Total Fees for all Appointment Bookings you request if
        such requested Appointment Bookings are confirmed by the applicable Company. In
        order to request an Appointment Booking, you understand and agree that Kuyam, on
        behalf of the Company, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain
        a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees, or (ii) charge your
        credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed One Dollar ($1) to verify your credit
        card. Once Kuyam receives confirmation of your Appointment Booking from the applicable
        Company, Kuyam will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions
        of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please
        note that Kuyam cannot control any fees that may be charged to a User by his or
        her bank related to Kuyam’s collection of the Total Fees, and Kuyam disclaims all
        liability in this regard, including fees for dishonored payments. In connection
        with your requested Appointment Booking you will be asked to provide customary billing
        information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to
        Kuyam or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Kuyam for any confirmed
        Appointment Bookings made in connection with your Kuyam Account in accordance with
        these Terms by one of the methods described on the Website. e.g. by PayPal or credit
        card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit
        card provided as part of requesting the Appointment Booking, either directly by
        Kuyam or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the
        payment methods described on the Website. If you are directed to Kuyam’s third party
        payment processor, you will be subject to terms and conditions governing use of
        that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection
        practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using
        the services. Once your confirmed Appointment Booking transaction is complete you
        will receive a confirmation email, text message or a phone call (as determined by
        Kuyam in its sole discretion) confirming your Appointment Booking.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Appointment Fees</h3></p>
    <p>
        In consideration for providing the Services, Kuyam collects a fee from the Company
        (“Appointment Fee”). The Appointment Fee is equal to Five percent (5.0%) of the
        Services Fees plus $0.99, not to exceed $9.95 per Appointment Booking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where applicable, taxes and third party processing fees will also be charged in
        addition to the Appointment Fee. The Appointment Fee and any third party processing
        fees are deducted from the Services Fees before remitting the Services Fees to the
        Company. Kuyam will pay the Company the Net Services Fee as follows: (a) fifty percent
        of the Net Services Fee will be paid approximately within two business days of each
        completed Appointment Booking for Total Fees received by Kuyam, and (b) the balance
        of the Net Services Fees shall be payable approximately on or before two weeks following
